It enables users to:</span><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Analyze engagement patterns across lead segments</span></li>\n<li><span>Assess the conversion potential of warm leads based on budget and timeline</span></li>\n<li><span>View lead distribution by account, industry, job title, and geography</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Lead Investigation<br />\n<span> Visitors were impressed by the depth of insight provided in this module, which offers:</span><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>A comprehensive breakdown of lead outreach methods and their relative effectiveness</span></li>\n<li><span>Engagement metrics for all contacted leads</span></li>\n<li><span>An analytical view of active leads, determined from overall outreach performance and unsubscribe behavior</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>AI Lead Prediction<br />\n<span> A simplified yet powerful function, AI Lead Prediction allows users to input various parameters and receive predictions on whether a lead qualifies as hot or warm. This enables:</span><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Quick qualification of prospects</span></li>\n<li><span>Smarter allocation of time and resources</span></li>\n<li><span>Enhanced accuracy in forecasting campaign outcomes</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Lead Nurture<br />\n<span> The Lead Nurture module allows users to view and interact with individual leads. On selecting a lead, teams can:</span><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Access detailed insights into engagement levels</span></li>\n<li><span>Use an integrated chatbot to explore lead behavior</span></li>\n<li><span>Tailor sales outreach and personalize emails based on specific lead action.</span></li>\n<li>The Acumen dashboard also features a live campaign visualization panel, offering a high-level overview of performance metrics across multiple initiatives.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Key highlights include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li><span>A visual breakdown of overall campaign progress</span></li>\n<li><span>Real-time counts of accepted vs. deficit leads</span></li>\n<li><span>Visualizations of accepted leads across campaigns, providing clarity on success rates</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span class=\" fusion-imageframe imageframe-none imageframe-32 hover-type-none\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Acumen Intelligence at Japan IT Week 2025\" src=\"https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-09.01.08_cf688986-800x450.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive wp-image-3726\" srcset=\"https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-09.01.08_cf688986-200x113.jpg 200w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-09.01.08_cf688986-400x225.jpg 400w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-09.01.08_cf688986-600x338.jpg 600w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-09.01.08_cf688986-800x450.jpg 800w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-09.01.08_cf688986-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-09.01.08_cf688986.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 800px\" /></span><p><span>In addition, the Campaign Accounts section displays the full list of accounts utilized in each campaign, enabling easy tracking of outbound efforts and allocation.</span><span><br />\n</span><span> We also demonstrated how users can directly access:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Lead follow-up and nurturing guides</span></li>\n<li><span>Lead templates for outreach</span></li>\n<li><span>Point of Contact (POC) details created for each campaign</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Visitors appreciated how the dashboard brings together all these resources into a single, centralized interface — giving marketing and sales leaders everything they need to monitor progress, troubleshoot issues, and drive campaign effectiveness.</span><span><br />\n</span><span> This integrated system received positive feedback for its clarity, usability, and potential to accelerate both strategic decisions and tactical execution.</span></p>\n<p><span>We also introduced </span>Valid8<span>, Acumen’s email verification tool.

Inspired by platforms like MailerLite and ActiveCampaign, it enables marketers to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Group recipients and schedule bulk emails</span></li>\n<li><span>Design professional EDMs using a drag-and-drop editor</span></li>\n<li><span>Manage segmentation, delivery, and performance from a single platform</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Together with </span>Valid8 <span>and the </span>dashboard<span>, the </span>Email Builder <span>empowers users to easily launch and manage sophisticated email campaigns — without requiring technical expertise.</span></p>\n<span class=\" fusion-imageframe imageframe-none imageframe-33 hover-type-none\"><img width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Acumen Intelligence at Japan IT Week Spring 2025\" src=\"https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-08.14.52_212937b0-600x450.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive wp-image-3725\" srcset=\"https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-08.14.52_212937b0-200x150.jpg 200w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-08.14.52_212937b0-400x300.jpg 400w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-08.14.52_212937b0-600x450.jpg 600w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-08.14.52_212937b0-800x600.jpg 800w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-08.14.52_212937b0-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-24-at-08.14.52_212937b0.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 600px\" /></span><p>Key Learnings: What the Market Told Us</p>\n<p><span>Beyond visibility, the event offered a valuable opportunity to listen and learn.</span></p>\n<p><span>Compared to last year, we observed a notable rise in awareness of ABM and Intent Data.
