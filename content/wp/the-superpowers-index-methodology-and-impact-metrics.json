  "html": "<p></p><p><span>The 2024 edition of the </span><a href=\"https://www.dentsu.com/uk/en/solutions/b2b/superpowers\"><span>Superpowers Index by dentsu B2B</span></a><span> presents a rich set of findings that delve into understanding and optimising B2B buyer experience.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Index is a powerful benchmarking and diagnostic tool constructed to explain the relationship between buyer experience and commercial outcomes, the report would cover in no particular order, these trends:</span></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h3>1. Fine margins and growing competitive pressure in B2B marketing.</h3>\n<p><span>There is diminishing differentiation between brands. In fact, the gap between winning and losing brands has shrunk by 78%.This is compounded by the many more brands that buyers now consider, on average – 62% more brands – as well as expanded decision groups that now have 7.4 stakeholders on average. To compete in this environment, brands must successfully differentiate on buyer experience</span></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h3>2. The rise of personal decision drivers over professional factors. </h3>\n<p><span>In 2024, for the first time personal decision drivers (e.g., feeling safe, brand values alignment, opportunities to learn) outweigh professional ones like price or efficiency. This marks a behavioural shift in B2B, one that emphasises trust, brand ethics, and relevance to individuals.  Emotional connection and personal resonance now play a central role in deal-making, demanding a strategic pivot in B2B engagement.</span></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h3>3. Brand building in B2B: A differentiation initiative</h3>\n<p><span>How do B2B buyers perceive current brand communication efforts? 71% of marketers believe their brand positioning is strong, yet 60% of buyers perceive messaging as undifferentiated. That is not all. Buyers gravitate toward brands with credible reputations and visible employer responsibility.  “Feeling safe signing a contract” ranks as the #1 decision driver for two years running, and only 26% of buyers say brands are excelling at thought leadership.  B2B marketers must double down on brand trust,</span><span> distinctiveness,</span><span> and credible expertise to win skeptical buyers.</span></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h3>4. Optimise sales experience to reduce buyer inertia</h3>\n<p><span>Buying cycles are now 54 days longer than in 2021, averaging 379 days. Optimised experiences – especially those with strong digital onboarding, peer advocacy, and smooth contracting – can shorten cycles by up to 16 weeks. Dentsu estimates these delays cost the global economy $1.9 trillion annually.</span></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h3>5. Delivering personalisation and relevance at scale</h3>\n<p><span>B2B brands are struggling to meet buyer demands for tailored interactions and relevant messaging.Over 70% of buyers want suppliers to better understand their individual roles and challenges. Yet satisfaction with personalisation remains stagnant at around 39%. Mass personalisation remains elusive, despite the maturity of digital experience platforms and data tools.</span></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h3>6. The promise… and challenge of Account-Based Experience (ABX)</h3>\n<p><span> ABX – marked by high personalisation, targeted media, and content depth – leads to stronger commercial performance. Contracts are 2.1 times larger, NPS is higher (117% increase), and sales cycles are shorter by 27%. Yet only 5% of B2B interactions exhibit true ABX characteristics. Resource intensity, coordination challenges, and tech integration gaps hinder scalability.</span></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<span class=\" fusion-imageframe imageframe-none imageframe-4 hover-type-none\"><img width=\"600\" height=\"389\" alt=\"Two businessmen reviewing data and charts on a tablet, with printed infographics and reports on the table.\" src=\"https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-12-08-35-06-600x389.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive wp-image-3913\" srcset=\"https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-12-08-35-06-200x130.jpg 200w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-12-08-35-06-400x259.jpg 400w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-12-08-35-06-600x389.jpg 600w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-12-08-35-06-800x518.jpg 800w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-12-08-35-06.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 600px\" /></span><p><span>Three pivots have become clear:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Brand – invest in trust, story-rich brand building, and real thought leadership</span></li>\n<li><span>Experience – Design hybrid paths that emerge digital convenience with human trust and streamline interactions</span></li>\n<li><span>Personalisation – Use technology and data to personalise at the role and account level—especially for non-senior decision makers.</span> </li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n",
