  "html": "<p></p><p><span>In early June, London was abuzz with highly anticipated technology events that saw attendees from all over the globe, converging at. Both London Tech Week and The AI Summit provided the perfect backdrop for the Acumen Intelligence Team to engage with enterprise tech leaders who were actively seeking solutions to their most pressing challenges. </span></p>\n<p><span>London’s unique position as a global tech hub made it ideal for Acumen. Both events’ focus on practical solutions also align perfectly with Acumen’s approach to delivering data-driven and measurable results.</span></p>\n<p><span>To add another layer of meaningful activity was Enterprise IT News – Acumen’s publication arm – that was also on-site at these events to observe, interview, gather strategic knowledge and report!</span></p>\n<p><span>2025 started off in a big way for Acumen Intelligence with </span><em><a href=\"https://enterpriseit.news/event-report-japan-it-week-spring-2025/\"><span>Tokyo IT Spring in March,</span></a></em><span> and then Las Vegas in May, when Enterprise IT News attended Dell Technologies World 2025.  We reported about </span><em><a href=\"https://enterpriseit.news/intelligence-and-architecture-at-the-core-of-dell-technologies-world-2025/\"><span>companies that are in the business of pure intelligence</span></a></em><span><em>,</em> how </span><em><a href=\"https://enterpriseit.news/dell-tech-world-2025-how-industry-leaders-delivered-enterprise-ai-value-at-scale/\"><span>AI will follow the data </span></a></em><span><em>,</em> and even how Dell as Customer Zero had transitioned their </span><em><a href=\"https://enterpriseit.news/3000-customers-later-the-dell-ai-factorys-shift-from-infrastructure-to-platform-play/\"><span>AI Factory portfolio to platform status.</span></a><span> </span></em></p>\n<p><span>Data volume and data foundation are significant, and this was evident in Prague when Zscaler execs like Jay Choudhry and Phil Tee talked about the data asset Zscaler owns which is crucial to enabling their vision of</span><em><a href=\"https://enterpriseit.news/from-firewalls-to-fabric-at-zenith-live25-zscalers-journey-to-agentic-secops/\"><span> Agentic-powered SecOps.</span></a></em></p>\n<p><span>In London, EITN zoomed into topics which were on everyone’s lips: </span><em><a href=\"https://enterpriseit.news/from-maker-to-billions-how-london-became-quantum-computings-and-ais-defining-moment/\"><span>artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and what NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang said about the UK’s supercomputing capabilities.</span></a></em></p>\n<p><span>Other significant themes that emerged throughout these many different conferences was the strategic deployment of AI to drive business value – aligning AI initiatives with clear business objectives, ensures that AI solutions are not just novel but also address specific problems and deliver tangible outcomes. </span></p>\n<span class=\" fusion-imageframe imageframe-none imageframe-13 hover-type-none\"><img width=\"777\" height=\"1024\"
