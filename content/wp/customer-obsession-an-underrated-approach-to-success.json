But what if the approach is about embedding customer’s perspectives into every aspect of the business from product development to the interactions and service delivery?</span></p>\n<p><span>Customer obsession is a strategy that places the customer at the center of the business model – in other words, instead of being a part of the equation, the customer should be the answer. </span></p>\n<p><span>Providing customer service, addressing issues and selling services that best feed their behaviour are the basic level. Customer obsession takes the hurdle of a full scale shift that will show an impact on the decision making of the organisation as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span>To exceed a customer’s expectations, it is essential to have a deeper understanding of the customer persona at an intrinsic level, anticipate their needs, and build a holistic approach that integrates all facets of the business—from strategy and operations to culture and measurements—toward the goal of building emotional customer connections that drive long-term loyalty and sustainable growth.</span></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p><span>Customer Centricity VS Customer Obsession</span></p>\n<p><span>Here is how Netflix differentiates the two terms,</span></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<span class=\" fusion-imageframe imageframe-none imageframe-4 hover-type-none\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"251\" src=\"https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image5-300x251.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive wp-image-3657\" srcset=\"https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image5-200x168.png 200w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image5-400x335.png 400w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image5-600x503.png 600w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image5-800x671.png 800w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image5-1200x1006.png 1200w, https://acumenintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image5.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 300px\" /></span><p><span>The primary difference between the two terms is the level of focus they give to the customer. A customer centric approach weighs a heavy focus on satisfying the clients final product or service, whereas a customer obsession approach will revolve around fostering an ongoing dialogue and taking action in real time to enhance their buying journey. In simple terms, the two approaches differ in </span>listening and conversation<span>. </span></p>\n<p><span>“Customer obsession is not just about considering the needs of customers. They need to be listened to at all levels of the company, understood and taken into account in the evolution and improvement of every process, service and product.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Nicolas Hammer, Co-founder and CEO, Goodays</span></p>\n<p><span>Customer obsession has emerged as a recent evolution of the customer-centric approach. The emotional connection fostered by customer obsession supports in enhancing the final product which leads to winning the customer centric approach. </span></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p><span>3 strategies on getting started with customer first mindset within an organisation </span></p>\n<p><span>Creating a customer first mindset goes beyond focussing on buying personas and ‘contact us’. Product development, pricing structure, payment options must all be strategized differently. Tear down the silos that hamper your customer experience, bringing together customer data and omnichannel support into one platform to make customer interactions seamless.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Inspire the whole company</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Educating all departments of an organisation is the initial step for implementing a customer obsessed strategy. The leadership must go beyond communicating this customer obsessed approach – to embodying this culture, galvanising the workforce towards sharing this common goal. This empowers cross functional teams to be highly motivated to innovate and excel in delivering unparalleled customer value. The collective contribution creates the momentum that fosters a persuasive culture of excellence, which, in turn, enhances the customer experience to drive sustainable competitive advantage. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Building the right mindset</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>When incorporating a customer obsessed strategy, the mindset or the DNA of an organisation requires a deep rooted belief that the customer is at the heart of a business; nurturing this culture will improve the organization’s long term health and longevity; whereas if not this approach will act as a burden to some employees. Training and development programs support embedding these values into the company culture. Empowering employees to take ownership of customer outcomes by understanding customer perspectives would be a step to begin with. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Innovate and Iterate </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Before implementing new strategies, it is necessary to gain a clear understanding through customer surveys, feedback and data analytic metrics such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) to achieve insights into customer relationships on the current situation of the organisation. Basing, on the given information, develop a customer centric vision and strategy which ranges from short term goals to long term roadmaps with the right metrics. </span></p>\n<p><span>In all of this, consistency is the key to achieving all over the period of time.  </span></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p><span>Qualities of been customer obsessed </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Empathy</span></li>\n<li><span>Respect </span></li>\n<li><span>Simplicity</span></li>\n<li><span>Communication</span></li>\n<li><span>Customer focus</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>7 habits of customer obsessed companies.
